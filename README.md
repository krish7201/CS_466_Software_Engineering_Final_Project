### Project documentation/artifacts

- Problem statement
  - The problem to be solved: (Kris)
    
    The widespread accessibility of the internet and quick internet speeds has meant that more people can access online content on demand. One specific use for this speed and accessibility has been online classes. Teachers could post their content online, especially if the content is otherwise difficult to find, for students to easily access.
    
    There’s been a recent rise and offloading of students onto online platforms as opposed to in-person classes for the sake of accessibility and convenience, potentially also lesser cost. This has meant for the increasing need for easy-to-use centralized learning platforms. Given that learning platforms are a recent development in scholarly technology, they aren’t necessarily as streamlined as they could be.
    
    Important information can be cryptic, inconsistent, and scattered when it comes to these online learning platforms. Having an even easier means of accessing resources related to academic planning and course related material would be beneficial for students.  

  - Description of current situations: (Mark)

    Popular educational platforms, although offering a centralized area to access course resources, allow for inconsistency with how users of the platform (dominantly instructors) format and display information, creating a noncohesive and messy platform.

    Along with this, many additional features or online tools are offered by existing platforms but are not fully developed to be useful or competitive with external tools.

- System architecture description, including the architectural style
  - Target Environment: (Steeff)

    Our architectural style is model view controller, the one Apple uses
    
    It’s intended to be multi-system via a web app

    - The environment in which the delivered system has to
    perform a specified set of system tests: 
      o	User-Focused Testing:
    - UI Response Times
    - Commands perform in less than 2 milliseconds in high traffic.
    - Security Vulnerabilities
    - Firewalls and intrusion detection.
    - Data Accuracy
    - Measuring effectiveness of learning strategies and tools.
      o	Software Compatibility:
    - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge
      o	System Testing:
    - Testing on devices such as desktops, laptops, and mobile phones.
    - Stress testing for a surge in user activity such as exams.
