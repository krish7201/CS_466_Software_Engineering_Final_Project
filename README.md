### Project documentation/artifacts

- Problem statement
  - The problem to be solved: (Kris)
    
    The widespread accessibility of the internet and quick internet speeds has meant that more people can access online content on demand. One specific use for this speed and accessibility has been online classes. Teachers could post their content online, especially if the content is otherwise difficult to find, for students to easily access.
    
    There’s been a recent rise and offloading of students onto online platforms as opposed to in-person classes for the sake of accessibility and convenience, potentially also lesser cost. This has meant for the increasing need for easy-to-use centralized learning platforms. Given that learning platforms are a recent development in scholarly technology, they aren’t necessarily as streamlined as they could be.
    
    Important information can be cryptic, inconsistent, and scattered when it comes to these online learning platforms. Having an even easier means of accessing resources related to academic planning and course related material would be beneficial for students.  

  - Description of current situations: (Mark)

    Popular educational platforms, although offering a centralized area to access course resources, allow for inconsistency with how users of the platform (dominantly instructors) format and display information, creating a noncohesive and messy platform.

    Along with this, many additional features or online tools are offered by existing platforms but are not fully developed to be useful or competitive with external tools.

### System architecture description, including the architectural style
  - Target Environment: (Steeff)

    Our architectural style is model view controller, the one Apple uses
    
    It’s intended to be multi-system via a web app

    - The environment in which the delivered system has to
    perform a specified set of system tests: 
      - User-Focused Testing:
        - UI Response Times
          - Commands perform in less than 2 milliseconds in high traffic.
        - Security Vulnerabilities
          - Firewalls and intrusion detection.
        - Data Accuracy
          - Measuring effectiveness of learning strategies and tools.
      - Software Compatibility:
        - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge
      - System Testing:
        - Testing on devices such as desktops, laptops, and mobile phones.
        - Stress testing for a surge in user activity such as exams.

### Specification (Functional and non-functional requirements)
  - Functional requirements: 
    - Authentication – Users must be able to create accounts using a username and password and include account recovery measures.
      - Teacher accounts must be able to provide class info such as grades and exam dates.
      - Student accounts must be able to see their class info provided by the teachers.
    - Management – Admins must be able to manage accounts and perform administrative tasks.
    - Features – Users must be able to use features such as a grade calculator and a scheduler.
      
  - Nonfunctional requirements:
    - Performance – The system must perform commands flawlessly and within time expectations such as no more than 2 milliseconds to calculate grades.
    - Security – The system must securely store all personal information and grades and encrypt this data to ensure privacy.
    - Scalability – The system must support an ever-growing user base starting with 5,000 concurrent users.
  
  Availability – The website should be available 24/7 with exceptions to scheduled maintenance of one hour a week. In short, uptime must be 99.9 percent

  - Design patterns: patterns used or plan to use in the next delivery
    - We only intend to implement grades, our design pattern would likely not stray far from the pattern we used to implement the course registration

### Implementation (probably in the code) 
  Implementation is simple, go to this link and use the roles I mention on page 29/30: http://ec2-3-67-134-137.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com/login.php
  I, Kris, will continue to host the database until further notice.
  My individual report details the implementation slightly better. Basically we just implemented using the WAMPP stack, the EC2 server is hosted on a windows Amazon AWS EC2 instance, the database is and RDS instance from Amazon AWS, we interface with the database via PHP, the webpages are programmed with a combination of PHP, JS, and CSS. We used bootstrap for the majority of styling and made sure to separate the JS, PHP, and CSS from the major web pages which are on the root of the project. 
  If you want to install XAMPP locally to view what the server is doing and what our files contain, follow these instructions (feel free to let me know if anything goes wrong):
  #############################################################################
  #FOR VIEWING
  #############################################################################
  install xampp 8.0.3 locally (for viewing database in relative real time [need to refresh page])
  - - edit the file in the c drive under xampp/phpmyadmin/ after installation called config.inc.php
  - - - paste in the following code under the next line after all of the first server instance in the aforementioned file but above the "End of Servers configuration" multi-line comment
  -- go to xampp/htdocs/ and delete everything except the xampp, img, and dashboard folders and then paste our project code into the directory
  - - launch xampp control panel and turn on apache/mysql and then click admin on both in the same control panel
  -- a browser window should open redirecting you to our home page, the same is the case if you just use the hosted link, but for viewing what’s going on in the database you’ll need to do it this way.

### Testing: what types of testing done
  Tests were done  to ensure basic functionality of all systems implemented: the following tests were considered
  - Criteria for the system tests: 
    - UI should be user-friendly and intuitive
    - Design is appealing and understandable
      
### Plan for next delivery
  - Requirements to be developed
  - Refactoring ideas, on both design and code
    - Make everything apply to Bootstrap framework.
    - Ensure that everything is shipshape code wise. Further get rid of PHP and JS in PHP files to make them more clean. 
    - Style things further,
    - Etc.
